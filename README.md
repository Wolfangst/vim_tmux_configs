PURPOSE: Just some basic vim/tmux things so I don't have to fully re-write them again later and can port them to different environments

ASSUMPTIONS: the template.go file is in the same directory as the vimrc.

There's a template for go files which I'm sure I'll re-write a week into actually using the language properly. 

Further work required to rice vim fully and I should get around to making tmux better (being able to copy inside a single pane only would be nice). Vim does some nice templating for Go files and will automatically update the last modified field.
